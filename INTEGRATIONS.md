### TODO 01-22-25
- Paul / Backend Team:
    - [x] Ensure login doesn't fail and require a restart of the program upon initial login
    - [ ] Ensure that all bubbles / messages are written to the respective JSON files when requested
    - [ ] Add getLocal and getDynamic functions for each bubble/message method, which will first get local messages and then dynamic messages from the Pronto servers
    - [ ] Add sendMessage method

- Diana / Frontend Team:
    - [ ] Make the little red unread bubble icon disapear if there are not any unread messages in said bubble
    - [ ] Smooth out how messages are rendered (instead of being displayed on little cards, make a smoother frame for message information)
